CODESTYLE
---------
* two space indents
* at most 100 characters per line
* the cora imports are listed below the library imports
* space after if, cond, while
* space before opening brace
* opening brace on the same line as if / else / for / while statement
* either
    if (cond) statement
  or
    if (cond) {
      statement
    }
  but never
    if (cond)
      statement
* the names of global variables in a class start with an underscore, except in record types

ARCHITECTURE
------------
* any dependency outside the standard library is only used in ONE class which serves as a facade (so replacing it can be done just by editing that one class)
* packages should be usable by outsiders with no understanding of how they are implemented beyond the public classes
* only make those classes public that genuinely serve a purpose to be public; favour the use of interfaces and factories over exposing details that users have no need to understand
* packages should not be too large: an average programmer should be able to fully understand a package in one week
  (note that for instance termination and termination.dps are different packages -- and should interact with each other like any distinct packages)
* code (and dependencies) should generally be structured following the advice in the handouts

PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------
* we roughly use XP as a development method
* when you edit a package, you should either fully understand that package or discuss closely / pair program with someone who does
* everything should be tested; tests should be written alongside the code
* don't leave prints in unit tests (since this will spam the output of build --info)
* follow the development guidelines in the handouts (especially section 6 in handout1 and section 2 in handout2)
